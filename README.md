Enterprise Frameworks


	Group Project Proposal


June 2012






 
 
An introduction to the project subject matter. 
=============================================
The group proposes to develop an online application for a Car Rental Business. This business will be a web based business where customers can log onto a website and book car hire from four different locations throughout the country, Dublin, Cork, Galway and Limerick.
It is proposed that this will be a pure web based business where we will sell car hire to individuals and companies on behalf of companies with fleets of cars. Customers will log on to our website and after choosing options of the location they wish to hire the car from and the category of car they will be given a list of cars available from that location for the dates that they require. The hire price will for each car will be given and the customer can then choose which car they wish to hire. The customer can then proceed to check out and pay for the car hire by either credit card or paypal. The car fleet company will be notified and the particular car will be no longer available for hire.
It is proposed to develop the application using C# and Asp.net on the Microsoft Visual Studio IDE with a mySql database.

The goals of the project.
========================
•	To develop electronic services (e-services) including interactive services, electronic transactions, web based applications etc. that can facilitate efficient and cost-effective on-line transaction processing dissemination / delivery of on-line information to customers and car fleet owners.
•	To develop electronic services (e-services) including interactive services, electronic transactions, web based applications etc. that can facilitate efficient and cost-effective on-line transaction processing dissemination / delivery of on-line information to customers and suppliers.
•	To develop electronic services (e-services) including interactive services, electronic transactions, web based applications etc. that can facilitate efficient and cost-effective on-line transaction processing dissemination / delivery of on-line information to staff, students and to public.
•	To continuously enhance the approaches used in applications development and the capabilities of analysts and project leaders in facilitating process changes.
•	To establish reliable and secure construct in administrative computing environment to ensure smooth operations in mission critical applications.
•	.That within 2 months that we will have a fully functioning web site where customers can log on search, book and pay for car hire.
•	That car hire companies can log on and 

The strategy that will be employed to meet the stated project goals.
==================================================================== 
The goals of the project having been clearly defined we will set out clearly what we want to do in the project. How we arrive with the solution that we require. We will set out a list of major tasks to be completed during the project, breaking each one into smaller components. We will list each of these and allocate them out to a member of the group to take responsibility for the task. We will review and amend these tasks as the project proceeds ensuring at all times that the project goals are being adhered to.

The key characteristics of your project in terms of functionality.
================================================================= 
The customer can go online to our website and having been given options to enter dates of car hire, locations that they wish to collect the car from will be given an option to hire cars that are available for hire on that particular date from that location.
The customer will be able to book the car hire online and pay for it by credit card or paypal
The Car Fleet companies will have their own section of the web site where they can log on and amend the details of cars available and check which cars have been hired out. 
The data will be held in a database. It is proposed that there will be a number of tables in the database including supplier, car, availability, booking, user location and payment. The following diagram represents the proposed tables `
 


 A list of the project deliverables that will be submitted on project completion
================================================================================
A fully functioning web application that works seamlessly
A technical report describing the application and how it works.
This report should include the following:
•	Project Plan
•	Background research and investigations.
•	Software development methodology employed 
•	Requirements analysis 
•	Use cases 
•	Architecture/Design approach 
•	Models (Class Models / Data Models etc.) 
•	Implementation of particular OOP constructs 
•	Design patterns and architectural patterns implemented in the application 
•	How cross-cutting concerns have been handled 
•	Security of the application 
•	Configuration of the application 
•	Scalability of the application 
•	Testing Approach (in terms of both functional and non-functional requirements) 

A  project log document signed by all members of the group which records
•	all actions and tasks carried out 
•	who carried out these actions and tasks 
•	when actions and tasks were carried out 
•	the time spent on the actions and tasks 

Demonstrate that the project has the traits and qualities of an enterprise application. 

Provide a presentation of the project and demonstrate the developed application.
